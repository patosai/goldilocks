Modulate room temperature with nature's help!


About
----------
This project was created as a response to our dorm's heating services.
Heaters are left on, leaving dorms hot while cool air circulates outside.

Using SmartThings, an Arduino (with the SmartThings shield), and some code, we built a tool to automatically open the window according to actual and desired temperature.

Now some of you may wonder why we can't just turn the heat off.

I honestly don't know why.
